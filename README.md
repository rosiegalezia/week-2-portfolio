# week-2-portfolio

## Description

This project is a first iteration of a personal portfolio website. It will function as a website to use for future jobs, as well as a way to practice the skills learnt so far in the front-end web development bootcamp.

This was a good opportunity to practice applying CSS grids and flexbox, and learn about responsive design.
